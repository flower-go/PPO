    <H1>A. Self-play analysis</H1>
    First part of the results analysis focuses on describing map properties and acknowledge the presence of the "off diagonal problem".
    <h2>1. Which maps are hard even for self-play?</h2>
    You can see results here: <a href="./results_sort_basic_allstacks.html" target="_blank">results_sort_basic_allstacks.html</a>
    <br>Primarily, I have compared experiment without stacking option, which are my most straightforward baseline. I have computed
    average results on the diagonal (cause that is where we suppose SP to be quite good), std error and Coefficient of variance
    , which is just the ratio of previous two metrics. In the results for
    nostack option, we can divide maps into three groups:
    <ul>
        <li> very hard maps (does not even convergate)</li>
        <li>unstable maps (contains zero on diagonal, so they are expected to be hard even for SP). These maps also have lower
        avg results and they also have CoV over 0.3</li>
        <li>Stable and quite easy map for SP, has CoV less or equal 0.3 and high average score on diagonal.</li>
    </ul>

    I have run same analysis for channels and tuple stacking options. We can see some maps have good score over all experimetns, while
    other maps performs substantially differently depending on the stacking type. There is more analysis on stacking influence following.

    <h2>2. Stacking influence</h2>
    Results for this part can be found here: <a href="./sorted_stack_np.html" target="_blank">sorted_stack_np.html</a> <br>
    Results indisputably shows the important influence of frame stacking. Overall best is to have no stacking, which indicates that
    selfplay agents are not capable to use the potential of the information about history or they simply learn faster and
    sufficiently good without it. The worst type of frame stacking are channels, there are 5 maps, where chan experiments
    even did not converge. There are also some maps, although in minority, where channels performed quite good and
    I hdo not have an explanation yet - TODO maybe these maps requiere the history info for better strategies?

    <h2>3. qualitative analysis</h2>
    In the table with all results (<a href="./all_results.html" target="_blank">all_results.html</a>) you can see not the original
    resuls heat maps, but reordered ones (using hierarchical clustering to reorder rows and columns to group most similar
    vectors together). We can observe that some layouts
    #TODO ze analyza tohoto bude

    <h2>4. Off diagonal problem </h2>
    The off diagonal problems shows itself in many tested layouts, which can be seen on the heat map pictures.
    We also wanted to quantify this problem and explore various metrics which can provide new insights for this problem.
    You can see heat maps ordered by various metrics in the following tables:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./results_off_diagchannels.html" target="_blank">results_off_diagchannels.html</a></li>

        <li><a href="./results_off_diagnostack.html" target="_blank">results_off_diagnostack.html</a></li>

        <li><a href="./results_off_diagtuple.html" target="_blank">results_off_diagtuple.html</a></li>
    </ul>

    Different metrics causes different sorting into groups. The ratio of the average on diagonal to average outside
    diagonal divides layouts which demonstrates off diagonal problem most clearly.
